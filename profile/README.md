## KouchDB ðŸ‘‹

The KouchDB project is a personal collection of CouchDB and CouchDB compatible databases and related tools.

I'm a huge fan of the CouchDB concept and architecture, but I don't like the Erlang implementation. There's a lot to like in the nodejs-based rewrite, PouchDB, but it's not mature enough yet on the server side (as of 2023), especially for cloud deployment. I have evaluated both variants for different projects, and a few other ones, as well as some experiments in rolling my own CouchDB-compatible engine. Some of the repos in this collection are related to such evaluations and experiments.
