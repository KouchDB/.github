## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Personal collection of CouchDB and CouchDB compatible databases and related tools.

I'm a huge fan of the CouchDB concept and architecture and have evaluated it several times for different projects and never ended up choosing it.

Some of the stuff found in this repo were experiments to help evaluate various configurations of CouchDB/PouchDB and creation of custom CouchDB-compatible datastores.
