## KouchDB ðŸ‘‹

The KouchDB project is a personal collection of CouchDB and CouchDB compatible databases and related tools.

I'm a huge fan of the CouchDB concept and architecture and have evaluated it several times for different projects.  

This includes some experiments involving deployment of PouchDB (a nodejs rewrite of CouchDB) in various cloud-based configurations.
